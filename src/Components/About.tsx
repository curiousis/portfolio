            My interest in programming started as a kid’s dream and then become something more that just a dream years later.
            I have been programming for almost two years now. Most of my programming has  been focused around web-dev.  My knowledge in programming consist of bootstrap, tailwind, js, typescript, node-js, next-js, figma(for designing) and css.
